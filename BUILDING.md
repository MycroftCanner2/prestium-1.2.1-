# Building Prestium 2.0 (live-build)

Prestium 2.0 is built from scratch with Debian's **live-build**, the same tool Debian's own live
images use. Everything that makes it Prestium is in this repository: the package lists, the
customised files, the setup hooks and the pinned third-party downloads. 1.9.x was built by
upgrading and patching an unpacked root filesystem (`rootfs/`, `build-1.9.1.3/`).

- Base: Debian 13 "trixie", amd64. Archive areas `main contrib non-free-firmware`, plus
  `trixie-updates`, `trixie-security` and `trixie-backports`.
- Kernel: Debian's trixie `linux-image-amd64` (the 6.12 line, the same line Tails 7.x uses).
- Firmware: the full Tails 7.15 set, with `firmware-*` pinned to trixie-backports
  (`config/archives/prestium-firmware.pref.chroot`, priority 990), so `firmware-linux` is
  20260916 or newer. Extra firmware beyond Tails (network cards, TV tuners, Qualcomm, Samsung) is
  installed when the archive has it (`optional-packages.txt`).
- Boot: hybrid ISO, BIOS (isolinux) and UEFI, with **Secure Boot** through Debian's signed shim and
  GRUB (`--uefi-secure-boot enable`). Kernel command line as in 1.9.1.3: hardening options, the
  internal-disk (ahci/libata) blacklist with the patched live-boot fallback, `module.sig_enforce=1`
  and AppArmor.

## Requirements

A Debian 13 host (a VM is fine) with about 25 GB free and root access:

    sudo apt install live-build debootstrap squashfs-tools xorriso mtools dosfstools \
        curl gnupg gpgv git unzip npm python3 openssl

On a host that is not amd64 (e.g. arm64), also install `qemu-user-static` and make sure
`/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/qemu-x86_64` exists with flag `F`. The amd64 chroot then runs emulated,
which works but is several times slower.

## Build

    git clone -b prestium-2.0 https://github.com/MycroftCanner2/prestium-1.2.1-.git prestium
    cd prestium
    sudo ./build.sh

`build.sh`:

1. runs `scripts/fetch-thirdparty.sh`: downloads Tor Browser, Firefox, Node.js, Feather, The Lounge
   (npm) and the lurch source, checks each one against its publisher's OpenPGP signature
   (`thirdparty/keys/`) **and** the SHA-256 pinned in `thirdparty/versions.sh`, and stages them in
   `config/includes.chroot/usr/src/prestium-thirdparty/` (not committed; removed from the image by
   the last hook); it also downloads a fresh StormyCloud I2P reseed file, checks it with
   `scripts/verify-su3.py` (SU3 format, RSA-4096/SHA-512 signature against `thirdparty/keys/reseed/`,
   at most 14 days old) and puts it at `config/includes.chroot/var/lib/i2pd/stormycloud-i2pseeds.su3`;
2. runs `lb config` (options in `auto/config`);
3. runs `lb build` and writes `Prestium-2.0-amd64.iso` and `Prestium-2.0-amd64.iso.sha256`.

An interrupted build can be continued with `sudo ./build.sh --resume`; `sudo ./build.sh --clean`
starts over (`lb clean --purge`). Expect 1-2 hours on a normal amd64 machine (much longer emulated).

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `auto/config` | the `lb config` options (distribution, archive areas, boot loaders, Secure Boot, kernel command line, squashfs compression) |
| `config/package-lists/prestium.list.chroot` | the packages installed by hand in 1.9.1.3 (derived from its dpkg selections, build-only packages removed) |
| `config/package-lists/prestium-firmware.list.chroot` | firmware and CPU microcode (Tails parity) |
| `config/package-lists/prestium-2.0.list.chroot` | 2.0 additions: PipeWire/WirePlumber audio, pasystray, the assistant's GTK bindings |
| `config/package-lists/live.list.chroot` | live-boot (no live-config: Prestium sets up its user itself) |
| `config/archives/` | build-time apt sources and keys: Tor Project, PurpleI2P (i2pd), LibreWolf; firmware pin to backports |
| `config/preseed/` | non-interactive answers (firmware licences, locale, keyboard, ferm) |
| `config/includes.chroot/` | Prestium's own files and the package files it changes, copied from the 1.9.1.3 root filesystem as a diff against the packaged files (see below), plus the 2.0 changes |
| `config/includes.chroot/usr/share/prestium/build/` | build-only data used by the hooks (owners/modes manifest, enabled units, optional packages, final apt sources); deleted from the image |
| `config/hooks/live/*.hook.chroot` | setup steps, in order (below) |
| `config/hooks/live/9000-prestium-boot-menu.hook.binary` | boot menu labels |
| `config/bootloaders/` | boot menu entries: Prestium 2.0, nomodeset, camera and microphone off |
| `thirdparty/` | pinned versions/SHA-256 (`versions.sh`), publisher keys, The Lounge's npm lockfile |
| `scripts/fetch-thirdparty.sh` | download + verify + stage third-party software |
| `build.sh` | the whole build |

### Hooks

| Hook | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `0001-prestium-build-dns` | build only: gives the hooks a resolver (Prestium's own `resolv.conf` has none) |
| `0010-prestium-optional-packages` | installs 1.9.1.3's dependency/recommends set (parity) and extra firmware, skipping names the archive no longer has |
| `0100-prestium-users` | `user` (1000, autologin, empty password until a session password is set), `i2pd` moved to uid/gid 2000, `thelounge`, `onion-grater`, `prestium-htp`, `prestium-ptdns` (2.0); groups `autologin`, `i2ptorrents`, `prestium-localweb`; root locked |
| `0200-prestium-thirdparty` | Tor Browser in `/opt/tor-browser` (read-only, Prestium policies + uBlock Origin), Firefox in `/opt/firefox` (local pages only), Node.js, The Lounge (+ offline patch), Feather |
| `0300-prestium-lurch` | builds lurch 0.7.0 (OMEMO for Pidgin) from the pinned source and purges the build tools again |
| `0400-prestium-system` | the exact set of enabled/masked units from 1.9.1.3 + PipeWire user units, gvfs network backends diverted, alternatives, CA list (emSign roots distrusted), dconf, plymouth theme, locale, version strings |
| `0500-prestium-permissions` | restores owners/modes of every included file (git does not store them) |
| `0600-prestium-apparmor` | enforces all Prestium profiles (LibreWolf included) and compiles them to catch errors |
| `0700-prestium-i2pd` | i2pd's real config in `/var/lib/i2pd`, owned by uid 2000 |
| `9990-prestium-cleanup` | final apt sources with signed-by keyrings, package list record, removes build-only files |

### How `config/includes.chroot/` was made

From the 1.9.1.3 root filesystem: every file not owned by a package, every package file whose
checksum differs from the package (`dpkg` md5sums and conffile hashes), and the package symlinks
Prestium replaced with real files (`/var/lib/i2pd/*.conf`). Generated files (alternatives, caches,
enablement symlinks, user database, locale data, `ld.so.cache`, `/etc/ssl/certs`) are left to the
packages and hooks. Package files Prestium deleted are handled by hooks (`dpkg-divert` for the gvfs
backends, removal of LibreWolf's packaged AppArmor profile and i2pd's init script). The large
third-party trees in `/opt` are not copied: they are downloaded and verified at build time.

## Updating third-party software

Edit the version in `thirdparty/versions.sh`, set its `*_SHA256` to `""`, run
`scripts/fetch-thirdparty.sh --repin` (it checks the signature and prints the new SHA-256), paste
the value in, rebuild. The Lounge is updated by regenerating `thirdparty/thelounge/package-lock.json`
(`npm install thelounge@<version> --package-lock-only`). LibreWolf, i2pd and Tor come from their
signed apt repositories and are always the newest at build time.
