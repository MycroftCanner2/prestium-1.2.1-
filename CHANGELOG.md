# Prestium 2.1: changes since 2.0

Prestium 2.1 is the current release on this branch. It keeps the Prestium 2.0 base — a from-scratch
Debian 13 live-build, the Wayland desktop, and the 2.0 privacy and sandboxing work — and adds the
following.

- **Tor Browser is no longer pinned to a single release.** Each build fetches the current signed
  stable linux-x86_64 tarball from Tor's official release metadata and verifies it against the
  Tor Browser Developers key. Prestium 2.0 pinned Tor Browser 16.0; that file was later removed
  from dist.torproject.org and broke the build. Future Tor Browser point releases do not need a
  repository update. Set `PRESTIUM_TB_VERSION=x.y.z` to use a specific still-published release.
- **Node.js is pinned to v24.22.3** (linux-x64), with SHA-256
  `4f2b175a6d53a5c617a80dba2676238a0688cef28c6da4eba35c7d844e66fcfb` from the signed
  `SHASUMS256.txt`. Prestium 2.0 used v24.22.2.

# Prestium 2.0: changes since 1.9.1.3

Prestium 2.0 modernized the original 2023 Prestium build. It is rebuilt from scratch with Debian's
live-build on Debian 13 "trixie" (see BUILDING.md), and it moves the desktop to Wayland with app
sandboxing and stricter failure handling.

This is one combined list of everything that changed in 2.0 since the previous release, 1.9.1.3.

## Build system and supply chain
- **Built with live-build** from a configuration in git (package lists, Prestium's files, hooks)
  instead of upgrading and patching an unpacked root filesystem. Anyone can rebuild the ISO with
  `sudo ./build.sh`. `build.sh` runs the live-build stages itself, holds an exclusive build lock, and
  `--resume` cleans up leftover chroot mounts and duplicate apt sources.
- The legacy 1.9.1.3 trees (`rootfs/`, `iso/`, `build-1.9.1.3/`) are gone from this branch. They remain
  in `prestium-1.6-update` and in git history.
- **Every third-party download** (Tor Browser, Firefox, Node.js, The Lounge, Feather, lurch, the I2P
  reseed file) is checked against its publisher's signature and a SHA-256 pinned in the repository.
  Downloads are HTTPS-only, redirects included, and the Debian mirrors use `https://`.
- i2pd, LibreWolf and Tor come from their own signed apt repositories. Each is `signed-by` its own key,
  and apt pins let each repository supply only its own packages, at build time and in the image.
- The Lounge is pinned exactly (4.5.2) and installed from a committed lockfile. Its git dependency,
  irc-framework, is checked file by file against the pinned commit on every build.
- Cached downloads and installs are re-checked before reuse. The I2P reseed file is cached and reused
  (default 24 hours) so rate limits don't break rebuilds, and every copy still passes signature and age checks.
- Fixed: 1.9.1.3 shipped the build machine's `/etc/resolv.conf`. 2.0 ships `nameserver 127.0.0.1`
  (no system DNS).

## Base system, hardware and audio
- Debian 13 trixie with updates and security fixes, kernel from the 6.12 line (Tails' line), firmware
  from trixie-backports (the Tails 7.15 set or newer) plus extra network, TV tuner, Qualcomm and Samsung firmware.
- Tor Browser 16.0, Firefox 159.0.1 (local pages only), Node.js 24.22.2, The Lounge 4.5.2, Feather 2.9.1,
  and current LibreWolf, i2pd and Tor. uBlock Origin 1.75.4 and NoScript 13.6.37.
- Secure Boot (shim + GRUB), BIOS boot and the hybrid ISO are kept.
- **PipeWire** with WirePlumber, pipewire-pulse and pipewire-alsa replaces plain ALSA (USB, HDMI and
  DisplayPort, SOF laptop DSPs, Surface devices). The panel volume control works with PipeWire.
- Galculator replaces SpeedCrunch, which is no longer in Debian 13.

## Wayland desktop
- **labwc** replaces Openbox (same menu and key bindings), **waybar** replaces tint2, swaylock and
  swayidle replace i3lock, mako handles notifications, grim and slurp take screenshots, wvkbd is the
  on-screen keyboard, foot is the terminal, and wdisplays replaces the X display settings.
- **Restricted socket for apps.** Apps get a Wayland socket on which the compositor hides screen capture,
  input injection, clipboard managers, the window list, overlays, the session lock and output control.
- **Wayland broker** (`prestium-wl-broker`). It makes the compositor's full socket root-owned so no app
  can reach it, and it starts the trusted desktop parts (panel, notifications, lock screen, screenshots,
  display settings, on-screen keyboard) with their own connections. labwc reads only a root-owned
  configuration, so no app can add key bindings or autostart commands.
- X11-only programs run through Xwayland and can't see or type into Wayland windows.
- Screenshots need a real click (Print) or drag (Alt+Print), so no app can take one unnoticed.
- Panel: a **Menu** button, icon-only window buttons (titles on hover), and an icon for the local-only
  Firefox. Browsers and dialogs get title bars with minimise, maximise and close.
- **Display:** resolution, arrangement and mirroring in Display Settings, monitor hotplug, and
  **Display Scale** (Auto or 100-200 %) applied by the compositor so every app follows at once.
- **Laptops:** working volume, mute, mic-mute and brightness keys with on-screen feedback, a Brightness
  slider, and touchpad settings (tap to click, natural scrolling, disable while typing).

## Network privacy
- **MAC address spoofing works reliably**, including after the kernel renames the network device. The
  `nomacspoof` boot option works again and has its own boot menu entry.
- **MAC address guard:** a connection set to the real or a fixed MAC address is reset to a spoofed one,
  a device about to use its real address is disconnected, and an egress filter drops frames sent with
  the real address. A safety alert appears if the guard isn't running.
- The firewall stays default-deny. Stopping or restarting it, including at shutdown, falls back to a
  drop-all (loopback only) instead of opening everything. DHCP lease renewal is allowed out.
- i2pd's per-boot port is opened inbound for IPv4 only, from the firewall config itself, so a reload
  no longer drops it. UPnP is off, the node is never a floodfill, and it still relays transit tunnels.
- polkit: the desktop user gets only the NetworkManager actions it needs (connect, Wi-Fi, save
  connections). Hotspot sharing, hostname and DNS changes need authentication.

## App confinement and sandboxes
- **Tor Browser and LibreWolf (I2P Browser) run in bubblewrap sandboxes:** an empty network namespace,
  only their own folders and `~/Downloads` from home, no D-Bus, no X11, Wayland only, and no_new_privs.
  Tor Browser can reach only Tor's SOCKS socket. LibreWolf can reach only i2pd's HTTP proxy.
- **Enforced AppArmor profiles** for LibreWolf (complain mode in 1.9.1.3), Tor Browser, Claws Mail,
  Gajim, Pidgin, OnionShare, Feather, LibreOffice (no network), The Lounge and the local-only Firefox.
  Confined apps can't use sudo, su, pkexec, Prestium's helpers, Tor's control socket or the system bus.
- onion-grater recognises apps by the file they really run, not by a path that could be faked.
- No swap ever, and internal NVMe disks are hidden like SATA disks.
- Yama `ptrace_scope=2`, so one program can't read another's memory or take its connections.

## Fail-closed behaviour
- Tor mode never reports success after a failed firewall reload. It rolls back, and if that fails, Tor
  stays stopped and the assistant says to restart before going online.
- Changing the i2pd port, tunnel hops or the reseed file rolls back completely on any failure, and
  the previous reseed data is kept until the new file has worked.
- **Safety notifier:** a persistent alert when the USB watchdog, MAC guard, Wayland broker, ptrace
  protection or shutdown memory wipe isn't working.
- Audit fixes: a local root escalation through the I2P Torrents helper is fixed, root helpers no longer
  follow symlinks in i2pd's or The Lounge's directories, the sudo helpers run Python isolated from the
  caller's directory, and OnionShare's onion services are limited to its own ports.

## Tor Connection Assistant (new)
- **Network → Tor Connection Assistant**: bootstrap progress, Reconnect, and modes **Direct, Snowflake,
  WebTunnel, obfs4 and meek** with Tor Browser 16.0's built-in bridges or your own.
- Snowflake and WebTunnel work without system DNS. Only the names they need are resolved with parallel
  DNS-over-HTTPS through the I2P outproxy. Tor's own traffic never goes through I2P.
- **Apply and connect** restarts Tor cleanly. **Cancel**, **Retry** and **Revert to previous** work at
  any point. The window stays inside the screen, and long errors scroll.
- Network menu: **Refresh I2P reseed (via Tor)** and **Manual reseed file**, both signature-checked.

## Apps
- **Feather is back on I2P** (i2pd's SOCKS proxy 127.0.0.1:4447), as in 1.7 and 1.8.
- **IRC (The Lounge)** no longer auto-connects before I2P is ready. It opens with a per-start login
  token, and it runs under its own AppArmor profile and hardened systemd unit.
- **I2P Torrents** has a dark Prestium theme.
- The local-only Firefox no longer shows Terms of Use and welcome pages at every boot.
- Fixed start-up failures of Claws Mail, Gajim and The Lounge under their AppArmor profiles.

## Known limitations
- Protected settings (Tor mode, tunnel hops, reseed, clock) work without a password for the desktop
  user. Confined apps can't use them, but unconfined programs can.
- Not every app path has been tested under AppArmor on real hardware, so a profile may still miss a rule
  an app needs.
- Open items from the final security review (signature key validity, irc-framework's build
  toolchain, early firewall self-checks, MAC guard rule refresh, an AppArmor health alert) move to PrestiumOS.
