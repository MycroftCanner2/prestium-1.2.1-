# 2.0 r15/r16: "lb build" split into its stages so the final apt sources go in after the chroot stage.
# They use the packages' own keyrings (signed-by /usr/share/keyrings/...); live-build's build-time lists for the
# same repositories use its trusted.gpg.d keys, and with both present apt refuses to run ("Conflicting values set
# for option Signed-By"). r16: the final files carry the build-time lists' names (prestium-tor.list,
# prestium-i2pd.list, prestium-librewolf.list), so whenever live-build re-adds its lists (a --resume, or
# "lb binary" configuring its tool chroot, which may be a full copy of the image chroot) it overwrites them
# instead of adding a second entry. Final copies left from an earlier run are removed first, and the older
# names (r14 and earlier) too; they are installed again once the chroot stage is complete.
